I am your host Dhanesh and this is my podcast episode # 2. 
Ittt has been a very long time since te first episode, sorry for the delay. 
But now on, I am going to try harder to meet you guys every week, possibly multiple times a week.
This is Poscast on Air - 2.0

First of all, I hope you all are keeping safe. These are turbulent times in history of human, and I urge you all to take care of yourselves and your loved ones in this Corona virus or Covid-19 pandemic.

Ok. Back to the topic. Today I want to talk about various Linux distributions that are out there for the grab, what is their use for us and how can anyone make use of those distributions.

If you think, Linux is only for technical administrator guys.. not for me!!! Wait.. that is not entirely true.
