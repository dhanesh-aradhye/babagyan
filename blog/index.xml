      <description>You learn things with years passing by. You learn how to read better, how to write better and how to communicate better using different mediums.
I had bunch of posts written long time back, which were mostly lost since 2018 or so. I was able to find some posts from 2013-2015 and I thought why not start my renewed journey of content creation by making those posts for everyone, again. Once these are on the website, then I would be even happier to take more steps on my new journey of content creation.</description>
