Case Study: Multiply Revenue as well as Customer Base

<br/><br/>
<strong> The Case: </strong>
<br/>
This is a project which can be very well used by any indstry to Multiply their revenue, increase the customer base as well as multiply loyal customer base with increased customer satisfaction ratio.
<br/><br/>
The Company is a multi-national sports and lifestyle shoes manufacturer and retailer which has stores spread across Asia and Europe. 
In its 15 years of existence, Company had created a loyal customer base primarily in the form of trendy teens and middle-aged (25-40 years old) men and women.
<br/>
While the footwear was mid-range to premium, the growth was never stumped for the first 14 years.
Infact, they recorded a growth of 12% for the 5 year period from 2007-2012. 
<br/><br/>
Prior to 2005, their only sales channel was in the form of company owned physical stores spread across Asia. 
Then in 2005, they expanded their presence through the franchise route to Europe. They also sell through multi-brand retail outlets and also have tie-ups with online retailers.
<br/>
In 2008, they started their website followed by a mobile app in March 2013. 
While the web platform served as an end-to-end channel allowing potential customers to scan through the variety of footwear, make a choice and complete the order by making the payment, the mobile app was essentially a scanning platform with no functionality to complete the order.
<br/><br/>
In early 2013, seeing the boom of social media as a channel, they quickly designed a social media campaign where people could dedicate a love message to their upset counterparts on the Facebook page of Company. 
<br/>
Though the campaign was highly successful and widely appreciated in terms of its popularity, it did not translate to enhanced sales. Their social presence was restricted to this campaign. 
<br/><br/>
In November 2013, the CEO and founder of the Company realized the need to use ‘Digital’ intelligently to achieve the business strategy and as a result, an expert in Digital Strategy and implementation was brought in.
<br/><br/>
The case study is to help the Company to <strong>digitally transform</strong> using below 3 point strategy: 
<br/><br/>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"> </span>

CLT20 2013 Twitter Analysis of League
<br/><br/>
CLT20 just concluded with Mumbai Indians winning the trophy. Congratulation!!!! Mumbai take the double of the IPL and Champions League title the same year. Chennai Super Kings did it in 2010.
<br/>
Sachin Tendulkar completed 50000 Runs in Cricket... AWESOME!!!
<br/>
<a href="../analytics/index.html">Here</a> is how the Twitter world was discussing the different topics in Champions Trophy T20 this year (2013).

Click <a href="../analytics/index.html">here</a> to find a graphical picture of the tweets during CLT20 2013. Total list of topics are <a href="../analytics/list.html">here</a>.
<br/>
This is our very own Social Media Bigdata project using Twitter Firehose - Live Tweets. There were about 300 to 1000 tweets analysed Live per second during the matches.

<br/><br/>
Babagyan CLT20 2013 Analysis
<br/><br/>
This is How it works at the technical level.
<br/><br/>
The twitter data is loaded in to the Analytics server by using Python program. This ocean of tweets is kept into the <a title="BabaGyan" href="http://babagyan.com" target="_blank">BabaGyan </a>Gyankund (knowledge base) for further analysis.
<br/>
Then another program (R with Python) scans the GyanKund tweets and uses its Intelligence to find the relevance and then sends it to BabaGyan.com database and web server.
<br/>
The database is then accessed by BabaGyan.com's <a title="BabaGyan Analytics" href="../analytics/index.html" target="_blank">Analytics</a> page to show analysis results in text and graphical format.

Tool: Daily Expense Tracker in excel - free to use and share

How many times it has happened that you wondered where all your money went? Where did you spend all of it? How frequently do you take out cash and spend it even more frequently and immediately.
<br/>
All you wanted is to know a trend of your spending so that you can plan and if necessary, control it.
<br/><br/>
There are many sites and phone applications that are available for this but not all are easy to use.
<br/>
Every application has its own method of usage - some ask you to create and define bank accounts while others just don't seem to be secure. All you really want is is place where you can mention how much you spend and earn and keep a track.
<br/><br/>
Here is an option for you in our very own EXCEL spreadsheet by <a title="BabaGyan" href="http://babagyan.com" target="_blank">BabaGyan</a>.
<!-- Collapse text from here -->
<div class="collapse">


<br/>
All you have to do is update the rows with your account transaction - both credit and debit. Also available is a Cash sheet where you should enter your cash transactions.
<strong>The ATM withdrawal transaction from Account tab is added into Available Cash in your Cash tab</strong>. This way, you don't need to worry about Cash Credits at all.
<br/><br/>
There is also an <strong>optional Forecasting tab</strong>. Here you should list down all the routine transaction like Rent payment, Fuel expenses, EMI installments, etc. This will help you predict how much you can save at the end of the month. If you need more to save, just spend less - at least try for it.
<br/><br/>
In short - Update the cells in <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Orange</span> </strong>before starting to use the sheet and daily update the cells in <strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">Green</span></strong>.
