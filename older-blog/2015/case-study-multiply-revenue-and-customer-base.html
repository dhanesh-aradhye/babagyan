Case Study: Multiply Revenue as well as Customer Base

<br/><br/>
<strong> The Case: </strong>
<br/>
This is a project which can be very well used by any indstry to Multiply their revenue, increase the customer base as well as multiply loyal customer base with increased customer satisfaction ratio.
<br/><br/>
The Company is a multi-national sports and lifestyle shoes manufacturer and retailer which has stores spread across Asia and Europe. 
In its 15 years of existence, Company had created a loyal customer base primarily in the form of trendy teens and middle-aged (25-40 years old) men and women.
<br/>
While the footwear was mid-range to premium, the growth was never stumped for the first 14 years.
Infact, they recorded a growth of 12% for the 5 year period from 2007-2012. 
<br/><br/>
Prior to 2005, their only sales channel was in the form of company owned physical stores spread across Asia. 
Then in 2005, they expanded their presence through the franchise route to Europe. They also sell through multi-brand retail outlets and also have tie-ups with online retailers.
<br/>
In 2008, they started their website followed by a mobile app in March 2013. 
While the web platform served as an end-to-end channel allowing potential customers to scan through the variety of footwear, make a choice and complete the order by making the payment, the mobile app was essentially a scanning platform with no functionality to complete the order.
<br/><br/>
In early 2013, seeing the boom of social media as a channel, they quickly designed a social media campaign where people could dedicate a love message to their upset counterparts on the Facebook page of Company. 
<br/>
Though the campaign was highly successful and widely appreciated in terms of its popularity, it did not translate to enhanced sales. Their social presence was restricted to this campaign. 
<br/><br/>
In November 2013, the CEO and founder of the Company realized the need to use ‘Digital’ intelligently to achieve the business strategy and as a result, an expert in Digital Strategy and implementation was brought in.
<br/><br/>
The case study is to help the Company to <strong>digitally transform</strong> using below 3 point strategy: 
<br/><br/>
